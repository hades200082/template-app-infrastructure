This is where IApplicationService implementations can be defined.

Process:

1. Create an appropriate interface in Application.Abstractions. Your interface should inherit IApplicationService
2. Create your service class in Application.Services, implementing your own interface.

Your service will be registered with DI automatically using your custom interface.
