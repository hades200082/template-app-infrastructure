# Contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Your help is appreciated.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](../README.md) and associated documentation.

You should also read [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests).

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Ensure that the description of your PR includes:

- A tag or link from to the issue that it resolves
- A brief description of the fix/approach you've taken
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a repository maintainer will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can make any changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch to update the PR.

### Your PR is merged

Once the maintainers are happy with your PR it will be merged into the `main` branch.
